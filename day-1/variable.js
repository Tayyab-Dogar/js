/* 

we can create variable by 3 keyword var, let and const.
if we create variable by using const then we cant change its value.
if we create variable using let than its has block scope 
if we create variable using var than it has globle scope (we can get/change it anywhere in the program)
note 
dont use var varibles keyword because of block and function scope issue.
